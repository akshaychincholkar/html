// AJAX is the combination of:

// A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object( to request data from a web server).
// Javascript and HTML DOM(to display or use the data).
 

// The name AJAX is itself a little misleading. XML might be used by AJAX to transport the data with a web
//  server behind the scenes. This signifies that the web page can be updated without reloading it.

// Another advantage of AJAX is that it helps the web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging the data 
// with a web server behind the scenes.
